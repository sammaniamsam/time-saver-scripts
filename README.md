# Synopsis

## The scripts in time-saver-scripts are written for Mac OSX Terminal

### get_media.sh

This script copies any photos and/or videos from an external
device and saves them in two separate directories
(**/Users/<user name>/Pictures** and **/Users/<user name>/Footage**)
in your home directory.

Within **/Users/<user name>/Pictures** and **/Users/<user name>/Footage**,
you create custom directories to store the media that was copied
from your external device.
